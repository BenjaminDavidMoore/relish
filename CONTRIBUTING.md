# How to contribute
_We happily welcome contributions from the community! Please follow this guide when logging issues or making code changes._

## Help Wanted
If you are interested in contributing but don't know where to start, check out the ["help wanted" issues][help-wanted] for ideas.

## Logging Issues / Feature Requests
All issues or feature requests should be created using [GitHub Issues][new-issue]. Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if there are any. Also, make sure to indicate the earliest version that has the issue being reported.

Lastly, please indicate if your issue is a **feature request** or **bug**.

## Making Changes
Code or documentation changes are welcome and should follow the guidelines below.

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make your changes to a new branch in your fork
* If making code changes, add tests for your new code ensuring that you have 100% code coverage
  * Run `npm test` to generate a report of test coverage
  * _We can help you reach 100% but will not merge without it_
* Once finished, submit a [Pull Request][pull-request-guide] for your changes
  * All Pull Requests should be made to the `master` branch
  * Make sure your branch is up to date with `master` (if not, perform a downstream merge and resolve any merge conflicts)
